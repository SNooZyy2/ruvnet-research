  Strategic Priorities

  1. Finish process-spawning (quick win)

  Already at 40.8% with only 33 files / 7.6K LOC. The 3 key service files (headless executor, container pool, worker daemon) are already
  DEEP. You'd need to read ~20 more files to hit 80%+ and close this domain out entirely. Highest ROI move.

  2. Deepen hook-pipeline (34.6% → 60%+)

  100 files / 26K LOC. The big file dist/src/commands/hooks.js (3,672 LOC) is still only SURFACE — promoting that one file to DEEP would
  jump coverage significantly. The hooks are the nervous system of the entire project, so understanding them informs every other domain.

  3. Follow up on CRITICAL findings

  You have 13 CRITICAL findings but zero follow-ups. The most impactful ones to verify and document deeper:
  - Fabricated swarm metrics (Math.random)
  - Three fragmented ReasoningBanks
  - npm package missing its own key modules
  - AgentDB completely unused despite being a dependency

  These should become formal entries in domains/*/analysis.md synthesis docs — none of which have been written yet.

  4. Write domain synthesis documents

  The domains/ directory was created with 14 subdirectories but all analysis.md files are empty or missing. The prior analysis lives in 6
  standalone markdown files that aren't linked to the DB. Converting the key findings into structured synthesis docs would make the
  research navigable.

  5. Deprioritize agent-lifecycle for now

  It's 629 files but ~90 are markdown agent templates that are largely boilerplate. Bulk-reading those gives volume but not insight. Focus
   on the actual runtime files first (agent-tools.js, agent-manager.js, spawn logic).
