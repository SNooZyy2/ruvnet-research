# R41 Execution Plan: Consciousness Layer + MCP Tools + AgentDB Simulations

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Session ID**: 41
**Focus**: sublinear-rust consciousness characterization, MCP tool layer audit, AgentDB latent-space simulations

## Rationale

- R39 found emergence subsystem at 51% real with **fabricated metrics** (Math.random). The consciousness files are the natural follow-up — are they genuine or more fabrication?
- sublinear-rust MCP tools show how capabilities are exposed externally — facades or real?
- AgentDB latent-space simulations are untouched novel architecture (clustering, hypergraph, self-organizing HNSW)

## Target: ~13 files, ~9,800 LOC

### Cluster A: sublinear-rust Consciousness + Strange-Loop (5 files, ~3,414 LOC)

| # | File ID | File | LOC | Domain |
|---|---------|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | 14320 | `src/consciousness-explorer/lib/advanced-consciousness.js` | 722 | memory-and-learning |
| 2 | 14310 | `src/consciousness/genuine_consciousness_system.js` | 709 | memory-and-learning |
| 3 | 14342 | `src/consciousness_experiments.rs` | 669 | memory-and-learning |
| 4 | 14326 | `src/consciousness-explorer/lib/proof-logger.js` | 664 | memory-and-learning |
| 5 | 14135 | `crates/strange-loop/wasm-real/strange_loop.js` | 650 | memory-and-learning |

**Key question**: After R39 exposed emergence as 51% fabricated, do the consciousness files contain genuine algorithms (GWT, IIT, Hofstadter strange loops) or more Math.random() fabrication?

### Cluster B: sublinear-rust MCP Tool Layer (4 files, ~3,391 LOC)

| # | File ID | File | LOC | Domain |
|---|---------|------|-----|--------|
| 6 | 14305 | `src/cli/index.ts` | 974 | memory-and-learning |
| 7 | 14221 | `npx/goalie/src/mcp/tools.ts` | 856 | memory-and-learning |
| 8 | 14392 | `src/mcp/tools/psycho-symbolic-enhanced.ts` | 802 | memory-and-learning |
| 9 | 14384 | `src/mcp/tools/domain-validation.ts` | 759 | memory-and-learning |

**Key question**: Do MCP tools connect to real solver implementations (R39: solver.ts was 75% real but NOT sublinear), or are they facade wrappers? Does Goalie have its own solver path?

---

### Cluster C: AgentDB Latent-Space Simulations (4 files, ~2,968 LOC)

| # | File ID | File | LOC | Domain |
|---|---------|------|-----|--------|
| 10 | 300 | `simulation/scenarios/latent-space/clustering-analysis.ts` | 797 | agentdb-integration |
| 11 | 307 | `simulation/scenarios/latent-space/traversal-optimization.ts` | 783 | agentdb-integration |
| 12 | 302 | `simulation/scenarios/latent-space/hypergraph-exploration.ts` | 707 | agentdb-integration |
| 13 | 306 | `simulation/scenarios/latent-space/self-organizing-hnsw.ts` | 681 | agentdb-integration |

**Key question**: Are these genuine research simulations (real vector operations, HNSW manipulation) or demo/visualization code? Connection to R40's HNSWIndex.ts finding (85% real)?

---

## Expected Outcomes

- **Consciousness verdict**: Genuine cognitive architecture or fabricated (like emergence)
- **MCP tool audit**: Real capability exposure vs. facade layer
- **AgentDB simulations**: Novel research value vs. demo code
- **R39 follow-up**: Complete characterization of sublinear-time-solver's ML/AI claims

## Stats Target

- ~13 file reads, ~9,800 LOC
- DEEP files: 838 -> ~851
- Expected findings: 60-100

## Cross-Session Notes

- R42 runs in parallel — covers ruvector edge-net, ruv-swarm neural models, ruvector novel compute
- NO overlap between R41 and R42 file lists
